We will create a user-friendly digital clock that displays the current time on a website with a beautiful design, title, and background image. We'll get the current time from the computer and display it in a digital format using JavaScript, . The clock will always show the accurate time, synchronized with the computer's time. This project will help us learn crucial skills such as working with JavaScript to retrieve the current time and creating an attractive website design.
